He still lives with his parents and is looking to settle down eventually after he's saved up enough money. His girlfriend isn't a very thrifty spender and likes to travel, so he occasionally makes exceptions leaving him with less money each month than expected. His aspirations in life are as \"normal\" as any person you might find on the street, and only wishes to live a stable life where he can somewhat satisfy the needs of his close family members and girlfriend.",
